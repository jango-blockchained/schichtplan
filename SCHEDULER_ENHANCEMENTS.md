# Scheduler Enhancement Plan

## Objectives

1. Improve shift distribution fairness
2. Enhance overall usability of the scheduler
3. Optimize algorithm performance 
4. Improve visualization and feedback

## Shift Distribution Enhancements

### Fair Distribution Algorithm

1. **Enhanced Fairness Metrics**
   - Implement a scoring system for shift desirability (early/late/weekend)
   - Track historical shift allocations for each employee
   - Balance shift types across employees over time

2. **Preference-Based Distribution**
   - Advanced preference weighting system
   - Consider employee preferences for specific days or shift types
   - Allow for preference strength settings (strong vs. weak preferences)

3. **Seniority and Rotation Systems**
   - Option to incorporate seniority rules in shift distribution
   - Implement rotation systems for desirable/undesirable shifts
   - Configurable weightings for seniority vs. fairness

### Implementation Details

- Add `DistributionManager` class to track and manage shift distribution metrics
- Extend `ScheduleValidator` to include fairness validation
- Update scoring functions in the generator to account for fairness criteria

## Usability Improvements

1. **Interactive Configuration**
   - Create a dedicated settings interface for scheduler parameters
   - Provide predefined configuration templates for common scenarios
   - Add detailed explanations for each scheduling rule

2. **Conflict Resolution Assistant**
   - Implement step-by-step guidance for resolving scheduling conflicts
   - Provide specific suggestions to fix constraint violations
   - Allow for selective rule relaxation with impact preview

3. **Scenario Testing**
   - Add ability to run "what-if" scenarios for different configuration options
   - Compare multiple generated schedules side by side
   - Score and highlight differences between schedule alternatives

### Implementation Details

- Enhance frontend configuration components
- Create new API endpoints for validation and conflict resolution
- Implement a schedule comparison service

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Incremental Generation**
   - Allow for partial schedule regeneration without starting from scratch
   - Optimize changes to existing schedules rather than full regeneration
   - Smart caching of intermediate results

2. **Multi-threading Support**
   - Implement parallel processing for independent schedule operations
   - Use worker pools for constraint validation
   - Background processing for large schedule operations

3. **Optimized Constraint Checking**
   - Prioritized constraint validation (check fast constraints first)
   - Short-circuit validation for common failure cases
   - Targeted revalidation for changed sections only

### Implementation Details

- Refactor `generator.py` to support incremental operations
- Implement thread pool for parallel validation
- Add caching layer for intermediate results

## Visualization and Feedback

1. **Enhanced Statistics Display**
   - Detailed metrics on shift distribution fairness
   - Employee workload visualization
   - Coverage satisfaction charts

2. **Interactive Schedule Editor**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for manual adjustments
   - Real-time constraint validation
   - Highlighting of constraint violations

3. **Employee Feedback System**
   - Allow employees to rate generated schedules
   - Collect satisfaction metrics
   - Use feedback to improve future schedules

### Implementation Details

- Create new frontend visualization components
- Implement real-time validation API
- Design feedback collection and analysis system

   - Mock services for isolated testing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test combined workflow with multiple components
   - Ensure data consistency across operations

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Benchmark against existing implementation
   - Test with various dataset sizes
