# Implicitly updated via other packages (checked from pip list --outdated):
# charset-normalizer (was 3.4.1, latest 3.4.2) - often a sub-dependency
# click (was 8.1.8, latest 8.2.0) - often a sub-dependency
# google-ai-generativelanguage (was 0.6.6, latest 0.6.18) - likely updated if google-generativeai is updated
# google-generativeai (was 0.7.2, latest 0.8.5) - if directly used, update; otherwise handled by parent
# greenlet (was 3.2.1, latest 3.2.2) - often a sub-dependency
# platformdirs (was 4.3.7, latest 4.3.8) - often a sub-dependency
# pycodestyle (was 2.11.1, latest 2.13.0) - often a sub-dependency of linters like flake8
# pydantic_core (was 2.33.2, latest 2.34.1) - often a sub-dependency
# pyflakes (was 3.2.0, latest 3.3.2) - often a sub-dependency of linters like flake8

# Note: Some dependencies like charset-normalizer, click, greenlet, platformdirs, pycodestyle, pydantic_core, pyflakes 
# were listed as outdated but are not directly in requirements.txt. 
# They are likely sub-dependencies and will be updated when their parent packages (e.g., flake8, other google libs) are updated.
# I am only explicitly updating packages that are directly listed in requirements.txt for this step.
