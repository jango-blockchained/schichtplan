# Detailed Task Plan

Below is a structured plan to address all remaining tasks, consolidate improvements, and bring the application to a fully polished, production-ready state.

---

## 1. Codebase Analysis

• The core application is in app.py, which handles:
  – Uploading and processing images with OCR (pytesseract + OpenCV).
  – Database operations via SQLAlchemy.
  – Flask endpoint definitions for routes, including POST /upload and GET /schedules.
• Templates are in templates/index.html, providing a web interface with Bootstrap for uploading files and viewing schedules.
• Logging, concurrency, and database usage appear stable, but the following items need improvement:
  – Linter issues (indentation, spacing, line lengths).
  – Type hints and type stubs for imports.
  – Configuration values (e.g., OCR settings, database details) are hardcoded in app.py rather than a centralized config.py.
  – Error handling can be further aligned with best practices by adding custom exceptions and user-friendly messages.
  – Documentation is mostly present but lacks full API docs (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) and thorough docstrings.

---

## 2. High-Level Objectives

1. Fully resolve linting and indentation issues in app.py (remaining tasks in .cursor/tasks).
2. Create and organize a config.py or similar to centralize all configurable values.
3. Add type hints for functions and use stubs for external imports to improve maintainability.
4. Enhance error handling to provide clearer messages and safer file type validations.
5. Expand test coverage to include additional edge cases (file handling, DB failures, concurrency).
6. Provide API documentation via docstrings and possibly an auto-generated OpenAPI spec.
7. Improve code maintainability: consider refactoring large functions and moving repeated logic into smaller helpers.
8. Provide additional user-friendly details in README: setup instructions, usage guidance, environment setup.

## 3. Task Breakdown

### 3.1 Immediate / High Priority
1. Fix remaining indentation issues in app.py.
2. Add type stubs for imports (pytesseract, OpenCV, etc.).
3. Add type hints to functions in app.py (and any other major scripts).
4. Create a configuration file (config.py) to hold:  
   – Database configuration (DB URL, credentials).  
   – File upload settings (e.g., allowed extensions, max size).  
   – OCR settings (Tesseract command paths, languages).  

### 3.2 Medium Priority
1. Improve error handling:  
   – Add specific exception classes for known error categories (e.g. FileTypeError, OCRError).  
   – Create user-friendly messages for errors.  
   – Add robust file type validation to prevent mis-uploads.  
2. Add or expand API documentation:  
   – Document existing endpoints (/upload, /schedules, etc.).  
   – Provide OpenAPI/Swagger spec where possible.  
   – Ensure docstrings are added and up to date with function arguments and return values.

### 3.3 Low Priority
1. Add more test cases covering:  
   – File handling edge cases (invalid images, unknown file types).  
   – Database connection failures (simulate DB outages).  
   – Stress tests with multiple concurrent uploads.  
2. Refactor large functions (e.g., parse_schedule_data) by:  
   – Extracting validation logic to smaller reusable helpers.  
   – Improving separation of concerns.  
3. Update READMEs and other doc files with:  
   – Project setup instructions (virtual environment usage, environment variables).  
   – Explanation of config.py usage.  
   – Additional details on how to contribute or extend the application.

## 4. Proposed Timeline and Milestones

1. (Day 1–2) Linting + Indentation:  
   – Correct final indentation issues, ensuring black/flake8 compliance.  
   – Resubmit app.py to confirm all linter warnings resolved.

2. (Day 3–4) Configuration File Creation + Type Hints:  
   – Implement config.py.  
   – Move existing hardcoded config values (DB details, OCR config) to config.py.  
   – Apply type hints to existing functions (especially in app.py).

3. (Day 5–7) Error Handling Improvements & Additional Testing:  
   – Introduce custom exceptions and friendlier error messages.  
   – Implement stricter validation for uploaded files (e.g., only .jpg, .png, etc.).  
   – Add test cases for error-handling scenarios.

4. (Day 8–9) API Documentation & Refactoring Large Functions:  
   – Add docstrings for all endpoints and major functions to clarify usage.  
   – Provide an OpenAPI/Swagger schema (optional, or use a simple doc approach in readme).  
   – Break down the parse_schedule_data function into smaller parts.

5. (Day 10+) Exhaustive Testing & Final Cleanup:  
   – Conduct concurrency and stress tests to measure performance.  
   – Validate error handling with forced DB failures.  
   – Complete README improvements (setup instructions, environment usage).

## 5. Implementation Notes

• Make sure to commit each feature branch separately, referencing tasks from .cursor/tasks as partial or full completions.  
• Use docstrings (Google-style or reStructuredText) for all functions once type hints are added.  
• Encourage consistent code formatting. (e.g., black, isort, flake8 as part of a DevOps pipeline if possible.)  
• Reserve time to verify production readiness (e.g., gunicorn for deployment, or any typical WSGI server).  
• Keep an eye on security aspects (file type validation, incomers do not override system files, etc.).

## 6. Summary

This roadmap organizes tasks into high, medium, and low priority to systematically eliminate known issues and refine the project's quality. By methodically addressing linting, configuration centralization, extended type hints, refined error handling, and thorough testing, we ensure long-term maintainability and robust performance. A clear timeline with incremental milestones helps track progress and ensures each step gets proper attention before moving to the next.
