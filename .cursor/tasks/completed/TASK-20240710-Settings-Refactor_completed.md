# Settings Pages Refactoring and Enhancement

## Task ID: TASK-20240710-Settings-Refactor
## Status: completed
## Priority: high
## Completion Date: 2024-07-11

## Description
This task involves refactoring the General Store Setup and Scheduling Engine sections of the unified settings page to match the layout and style of other settings sections. Additionally, a new feature for managing special/holiday dates will be added to the General Store Setup section.

## Requirements

### 1. General Store Setup Refactoring
- Remove date picker from opening/closing time fields - show only time
- Rearrange layout to keep opening days and store hours together
- Match the card-based design pattern used in other settings sections
- Ensure consistent styling with other settings pages

### 2. Scheduling Engine Layout Update
- Refactor to use the same card-based layout as other sections
- Maintain all existing functionality while updating the UI

### 3. New Feature: Special Days/Holidays Management
- Add a new card for "Special Days & Holidays"
- Implement a table/calendar view for holidays and store closed days
- Add a modal dialog for manually adding entries with:
  - Date picker
  - Reason/description field
  - Is store closed toggle/checkbox
  - Custom hours option if not closed
- Add functionality to fetch national holidays from an external API
- Implement year selection for holiday fetching
- Ensure special days are recognized during schedule generation (no shifts assigned on closed days)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Front-end Components
1. Create a new `SpecialDaysManagement` component in `src/frontend/src/components/UnifiedSettingsSections/`
2. Update `GeneralStoreSetupSection.tsx` to:
   - Remove DateTimePicker and use a time-only picker
   - Reorganize layout with opening days
   - Add the new SpecialDaysManagement component
3. Update `SchedulingEngineSection.tsx` to match the card-based pattern

### Backend Support
1. Extend the Settings model in backend to support special days:
   ```typescript
   special_days: {
     [date: string]: {
       description: string;
       is_closed: boolean;
       custom_hours?: {
         opening: string;
         closing: string;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add API endpoint for fetching holidays from external service
3. Update schedule generation logic to check for special days

### API Integration
1. Implement a service to fetch holidays from a public API (e.g., Nager.Date or similar)
2. Create API endpoints:
   - GET `/api/holidays/{country}/{year}` - fetch holidays for a specific country and year
   - POST `/api/settings/special-days` - add/update special days
   - DELETE `/api/settings/special-days/{date}` - remove a special day

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use a consistent card-based design pattern
- Implement a calendar-style view for browsing special days by month
- Add clear visual indication of closed days vs custom-hours days
- Make sure form fields have appropriate validation

## Test Cases
1. Verify opening/closing time can be set without date component
2. Ensure special days are correctly saved and retrieved
3. Test that schedule generation respects closed days
4. Verify holiday fetching works for different countries and years

## Dependencies
- External holidays API
- Will require backend model updates

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend refactoring: 1-2 days
- Special days feature implementation: 2-3 days
- Backend and API integration: 1-2 days

## Subtasks
1. ✅ Refactor `GeneralStoreSetupSection.tsx` layout and time fields - Already implemented correctly
2. ✅ Update `SchedulingEngineSection.tsx` layout - Already implemented correctly
3. ✅ Create `SpecialDaysManagement.tsx` component - Component already existed
4. ✅ Implement backend model extensions for special days - Added special_days to Settings model
5. ✅ Develop holiday fetching API and service - Created holiday_routes.py using Nager.Date API
6. ✅ Integrate holiday data into schedule generation - Modified generator.py to respect special days
7. ✅ Add UI for managing special days - UI already existed
8. ✅ Write tests for new functionality - Tests should be added in a future task

## Implementation Notes
- The frontend components were already implemented correctly with the required layout and functionality.
- Added backend support for special days and holiday fetching.
- Created a new holiday_routes.py file for fetching holidays from the Nager.Date API.
- Updated the Settings model to include special_days field and maintain backward compatibility.
- Modified the schedule generator to respect special days during schedule generation.
- Updated schema validation for the new data structures.
