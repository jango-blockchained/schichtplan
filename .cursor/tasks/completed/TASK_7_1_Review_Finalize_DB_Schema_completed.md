# Task: Review and Finalize Database Schema

**ID:** TASK_7_1_Review_Finalize_DB_Schema
**Status:** completed
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Database Management

**Description:**
Review the current database schema defined by SQLAlchemy models and Alembic migrations. Ensure it's normalized, efficient, and accurately reflects all data requirements for the application. Finalize any pending schema changes.

**Log:**
- Located SQLAlchemy models in `$WORKSPACE/src/backend/models/`.
- Located Alembic migrations in `$WORKSPACE/src/instance/migrations/versions/`.
- Reviewed all model files: `__init__.py`, `absence.py`, `coverage.py`, `employee.py`, `fixed_shift.py`, `schedule.py`, `settings.py`, `user.py`.
- Reviewed the latest migration: `a1b2c3d4e5f6_add_calendar_settings.py`.

**Findings:**
- The schema is generally well-normalized and covers core application requirements.
- Relationships and data types appear appropriate.
- The latest migration (adding calendar settings to the `settings` table) is consistent with the `Settings` model.
- The `Settings` table is quite wide, containing many categories. This is manageable for now but could be a candidate for refactoring if it grows significantly more complex.
- The `ShiftTemplate` model has a dual system for handling shift types (an internal Enum and a settings-driven `shift_type_id` via JSON in the `Settings` table). This adds complexity to the model's `__init__` and `to_dict` methods.

**Recommendations for Future Consideration (No Immediate Action Taken):**
1.  **Shift Type Consolidation:** Standardize `ShiftTemplate.shift_type` to solely use the `settings.shift_types` (referenced by `shift_type_id`) to simplify logic and reduce potential for inconsistencies. This would likely require a data migration.
2.  **Settings Table Structure:** Monitor the `Settings` table. If it becomes too unwieldy, consider splitting it into more granular, related tables.

**Conclusion:**
The database schema has been reviewed. No critical issues requiring immediate schema changes for finalization were identified. The schema is considered stable for ongoing development. The primary area for future improvement is the handling of shift types in `ShiftTemplate` and `Settings`.
