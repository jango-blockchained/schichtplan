# Error Resolution Summary

## Initial Issues
1. Logger error: `AttributeError: module 'src.backend.utils.logger' has no attribute 'error_logger'`
2. SQLAlchemy linter errors: `Access to generic instance variable through class is ambiguous`
3. Type mismatch between `SchedulerConfig` and `ScheduleConfig` classes

## Resolved Issues

### 1. Logger Issues
- Added missing `info()` method to the Logger class
- Updated the `error()` method to accept the `extra` parameter
- Fixed references to non-existent `error_logger` and `schedule_logger` attributes

### 2. SchedulerConfig/ScheduleConfig Mismatch
- Added a `from_scheduler_config()` method to the `ScheduleConfig` class
- Updated the code in schedules.py to use this conversion method
- Preserved backward compatibility by keeping the existing `from_settings()` method

### 3. SQLAlchemy Linter Errors
- The SQLAlchemy linter errors appear to be false positives due to type checking limitations
- The application is working correctly as demonstrated by successful API requests
- Created a pending task to add proper type annotations for SQLAlchemy models

## Testing Results
- Successfully made an API request to `/api/schedules/` endpoint
- Received a 200 OK response with the expected JSON data
- Server is running on port 5001 and responding to requests

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete the pending task to add proper type annotations for SQLAlchemy models
2. Consider adding type ignores (`# type: ignore`) for persistent SQLAlchemy linter errors
3. Conduct a comprehensive search for any remaining instances of the old logger pattern
