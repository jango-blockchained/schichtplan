# Task: Review Core Frontend Components and Hooks

**ID:** TASK_3_1_Review_Frontend_Components_Hooks
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Frontend Stability & Core Features

**Review Findings:**

*   **ScheduleTable.tsx**: Unable to read full content, preventing complete review. Appears to receive schedule data via props.
*   **ScheduleStatistics.tsx**: Good use of props and `useQuery` for data. Calculates statistics based on filtered schedules. Includes placeholder for interval coverage stats. Code clarity is good.
*   **useVersionControl.ts**: Effective state management for versions using `useState` and `react-query`. Handles API interactions and UI state for version selection and management.
*   **useScheduleGeneration.ts**: Manages generation process UI state with `useState`. Uses `useMutation` for API calls. Provides clear steps and logging for the user. Properly uses selected version.

Overall, the reviewed components/hooks demonstrate good frontend practices. The inability to read `ScheduleTable.tsx` is a limitation for this specific review task.
Review major frontend components (e.g., `ScheduleTable.tsx`, `ScheduleStatistics.tsx`) and hooks (e.g., `useVersionControl.ts`, `useScheduleGeneration.ts`) for state management, API integration, performance, and code clarity. Ensure they correctly reflect backend data and user interactions.
