# Task: Investigate Flask-SQLAlchemy Context Issues

**ID:** TASK_6_4_Investigate_Flask_SQLAlchemy_Context_Issues
**Status:** completed
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Addressing Known Issues

**Description:**
Look into potential Flask-SQLAlchemy context issues mentioned and implement solutions to ensure database sessions are handled correctly, especially in background tasks or complex scheduler operations.

**Progress:**
- Analyzed how the database session is used across the codebase
- Identified several potential issues in session handling:
  1. Inconsistent use of `db.session.add()` followed by `db.session.commit()`
  2. Missing error handling in many operations that use `db.session.commit()`
  3. Lack of proper transaction management in complex operations
  4. No consistent pattern for handling session state in background tasks
  5. Some files have code where `db.session.add()` is called without `db.session.commit()`
  6. Some places have inconsistent error handling with `db.session.rollback()`

**Implemented Solutions:**
1. Created a database utilities module (`src/backend/utils/db_utils.py`) with:
   - A `session_manager` context manager for safer transaction handling
   - A `transactional` decorator for functions that modify the database
   - Utility functions like `safe_commit()` and `add_all_or_abort()`
   - An `AppContextManager` for background task context management

2. Updated session handling in the scheduler generator module:
   - Modified `_save_to_database()` to use the new `session_manager` context
   - Added proper error handling with automatic rollback
   - Ensured consistent transaction boundaries

3. Created documentation for session management best practices (`src/backend/docs/session_management.md`)

4. Refactored a critical API endpoint:
   - Updated `create_schedule` in `src/backend/api/schedules.py` to use the new session management
   - Added proper error categorization for database vs. general errors
   - Removed redundant transaction handling code

**Recommendations for Future Work:**
- Continue refactoring other endpoints in `routes/` and `api/` using the new utilities
- Add session management to background task functions
- Update database session handling in unit tests
- Consider adding automatic transaction logging for critical operations
