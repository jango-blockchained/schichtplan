- Include "Today" button for quick reset
- Maintain context when switching views
- Save user preferences for default view

#### 2.2 Event Visualization
**Common Patterns:**
- **Color Coding:** Using colors to categorize events or represent resources
- **Card-Based Layout:** Events displayed as cards with consistent styling
- **Exact Time Display:** Showing precise start/end times for events
- **Event Stacking:** Overlapping events shown in stacks with clear indication
- **Popover Details:** Click/hover to reveal additional event information
- **Labels vs. Popovers:** Toggle between showing events as labels or in popovers

**Best Practices:**
- Maintain consistent color patterns for event categories
- Provide clear visual differentiation between events
- Use whitespace effectively to prevent cluttered views
- Include clear visual indicators for event duration
- Limit displayed information to essentials with option to expand

#### 2.3 Resource Visualization
**Common Patterns:**
- **Row-Based Resources:** Each resource displayed as a row with events across
- **Column-Based Resources:** Resources as columns with timeline flowing vertically
- **Resource Groups:** Hierarchical grouping of resources with collapsible sections
- **Resource Filtering:** UI controls to show/hide specific resources
- **Resource Color Coding:** Using consistent colors to identify resources

**Best Practices:**
- Allow toggling resource visibility
- Provide clear visual separation between resources
- Enable resource filtering from the header
- Support hierarchical resource structures
- Maintain resource context when navigating views

#### 2.4 Mobile-Friendly Designs
**Common Patterns:**
- **Responsive View Switching:** Automatically adjusting view based on screen size
- **Touch-Optimized Controls:** Larger hit areas for touch interaction
- **Swipe Navigation:** Using swipe gestures to navigate between time periods
- **Compact Event Display:** Simplified event representation on small screens
- **Mobile-First Agenda View:** List-based view optimized for small screens

**Best Practices:**
- Design for touch first, then adapt for mouse/keyboard
- Prioritize essential information on small screens
- Implement responsive breakpoints for different device sizes

- The React wrapper makes it easy to integrate with our codebase

### 2. View Types
We recommend implementing the following views:
- **Month View** with event labels for desktop
- **Week View** with detailed time grid for desktop
- **Day View** with resource columns for detailed daily planning
- **List/Agenda View** optimized for mobile devices
- **Resource Timeline** for advanced resource visualization

### 3. UI/UX Approach
The following patterns should be incorporated:
- **Segmented Control** in the header for view switching

- **Explanation Cards** for AI recommendations
- **Accept/Reject Controls** for each suggestion
- **Feedback Mechanism** to improve AI over time

### 5. Mobile Strategy
For mobile devices, we recommend:
- **Responsive Breakpoints** at 576px, 768px, 992px, and 1200px
- **View Switching** based on screen size
- **Touch-Optimized Controls** with larger hit areas
- **Simplified Event Display** on small screens
- **Swipe Navigation** between time periods

### 6. Accessibility Strategy
To ensure accessibility, we should:
