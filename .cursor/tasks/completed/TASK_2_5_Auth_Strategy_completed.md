# Task: Authentication & Authorization Strategy

**ID:** TASK_2_5_Auth_Strategy
**Status:** completed
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Backend Stability & Core Features

**Description:**
Define and implement a basic authentication (e.g., JWT-based) and authorization (e.g., role-based access) mechanism for backend APIs if not already present or sufficiently robust.

**Progress:**
- Analyzed the current authentication status in the application (no authentication existed)
- Implemented a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system

**Implementation Details:**

1. Created User Model with Role-Based Access Control:
   - Added `User` model with relationships to existing Employee model
   - Implemented `UserRole` enum (ADMIN, MANAGER, SUPERVISOR, EMPLOYEE, READONLY)
   - Added permission system based on roles
   - Included API key support for service-to-service authentication

2. Authentication Services:
   - Created `auth_service.py` with JWT token generation and validation
   - Implemented decorator functions for different access levels:
     - `login_required`: Basic authentication check
     - `role_required`: Role-based authorization
     - `permission_required`: Fine-grained permission checking
     - `verify_api_key`: API key validation for non-user requests

3. API Routes for Authentication:
   - Created `/api/auth/login` endpoint for user authentication
   - Added user management endpoints for admins
   - Implemented password change and profile management
   - Added support for API key regeneration

4. Database Migration:
   - Created migration file to add User table to database
   - Added default admin user for initial access

5. Applied Authentication to Existing API:
   - Added login_required decorator to schedule endpoints as an example
   - All other endpoints can be secured in a similar manner

**Notes for Future Development:**
- Frontend implementation needs to be added to support login/authentication
- Password reset functionality should be implemented
- Consider implementing token refresh mechanism for long sessions
- Add more comprehensive unit tests for auth system
- Add email verification for new user registrations
