# Task: Code Documentation (Comments)

**ID:** TASK_5_2_Code_Documentation_Comments
**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Documentation

**Description:**
Review and add code comments/docstrings for complex functions, classes, and modules in both backend (especially scheduler logic) and frontend (complex hooks, components).

## Plan

1. **Identify Complex Areas:**
   - Scan `src/backend/services/scheduler/` for complex Python modules and functions.
   - Scan `src/frontend/src/components/` for complex React components (especially those with significant logic or state).
   - Scan `src/frontend/src/hooks/` for complex custom React hooks.
   - Look for files/functions/classes with many lines of code, intricate logic, or a lack of existing comments.

2. **Prioritize and Document:**
   - Start with the most critical or least documented areas identified in Step 1.
   - For Python (backend): Add Google-style docstrings to classes, methods, and functions. Explain purpose, arguments (`Args:`), return values (`Returns:`), and any raised exceptions (`Raises:`).
   - For TypeScript/React (frontend): Use JSDoc comments (`/** ... */`) for components, props, hooks, and complex functions. Explain purpose, parameters (`@param`), return values (`@returns`), and important logic.

3. **Iterative Review (Self-Correction):**
   - After documenting a module or component, reread the comments to ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
   - Ensure comments are helpful and not just restating the obvious from the code.

## Log

- Attempted to document `src/backend/services/scheduler/generator.py`.
- Added initial docstrings for module, `ScheduleGenerationError`, `ScheduleAssignment`, `ScheduleContainer`, and `ScheduleGenerator` classes and their `__init__` methods.
- Encountered persistent Python linting errors related to "Module level import not at top of file" and undefined names within `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks after multiple attempts to fix.
- Halting documentation for `generator.py` to avoid further errors and will proceed to other files.
