# AI Schedule Generation Feature: Review & Improvements

## Summary
This task plan details improvements for the AI schedule generation feature in Schichtplan, addressing both frontend and backend components.

## Current Implementation Overview
- **Backend Core**: Rule-based schedule generation in `services/scheduler/` using:
  - `generator.py` - Main scheduling orchestration
  - `distribution.py` - Employee-to-shift assignment logic
  - Supporting components (resources, availability, constraints)
- **Frontend**: 
  - `useScheduleGeneration` hook - Generation process management
  - `ScheduleActions` - UI component for triggering generation
  - References to `generateAiSchedule` in components

## Identified Issues & Opportunities
1. Limited AI-specific implementation despite UI references to "AI Schedule"
2. Complexity in distribution logic that could benefit from ML optimization
3. No feedback loop for improving schedules based on user adjustments
4. Limited personalization to employee historical preferences
