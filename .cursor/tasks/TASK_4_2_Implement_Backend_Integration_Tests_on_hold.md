# Task: Implement Backend Integration Tests

**ID:** TASK_4_2_Implement_Backend_Integration_Tests
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Testing

**Description:**
Develop integration tests for API endpoints, ensuring they interact correctly with services and the database. Test the full schedule generation flow as an integration test if feasible.


## AI On Hold Note
This task is being put on hold. While some basic integration tests could be written, comprehensive tests, especially for complex flows like schedule generation, are best developed when the underlying API endpoints and services (e.g., AI scheduling, related APIs) are more stable and complete. Several related backend tasks are currently `_in_progress` or `_on_hold`. Revisit this task when those dependencies are further along.
