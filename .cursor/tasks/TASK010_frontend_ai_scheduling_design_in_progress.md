# Task: Design and Layout for AI Scheduling Frontend

## Priority

High

## Description

Design and implement the user interface for interacting with the AI scheduling features. This includes controls for initiating AI generation, viewing AI-generated schedule suggestions, and applying them.

## Objectives

- Design a user-friendly interface for AI scheduling.
- Create mockups/wireframes for the AI scheduling section of the frontend.
- Implement the layout and static components for these views.
- Ensure the design is consistent with the existing application's UI.

## Dependencies

- TASK005_implement_ai_scheduling_service_in_progress.md (for understanding backend capabilities)
- TASK007_create_ai_schedule_api_endpoints_on_hold.md (for API integration later)

## Details

### Key UI Elements to Design

1. **AI Generation Controls:**
   - Button to trigger AI schedule generation.
   - Options/parameters for the AI (e.g., date range, specific constraints to prioritize).
   - Loading/progress indicator during generation.

2. **AI Schedule Suggestion View:**
   - Display of one or more AI-generated schedule suggestions.
   - Clear visual distinction between current schedule and AI suggestions.
   - Ability to compare suggestions if multiple are presented.
   - Metrics/scores for each suggestion (e.g., coverage, fairness, cost).

3. **Suggestion Application:**
   - Controls to accept/apply an AI suggestion to the main schedule.
   - Mechanism to partially accept or edit a suggestion before applying.
   - Confirmation step before overwriting parts of the existing schedule.

4. **Status/Feedback Area:**
   - Display messages from the AI scheduler (e.g., "Generation complete", "No feasible schedule found with given constraints").

### Design Considerations

- **Clarity:** Users should easily understand how to use the AI features and interpret the results.
- **Control:** Users should feel in control of the AI, with clear options and confirmation steps.
- **Responsiveness:** The UI should be responsive and provide feedback during long operations.
- **Integration:** The new UI elements should seamlessly integrate into the existing frontend application structure and style.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Mockups/wireframes for the AI scheduling UI are created and approved (self-approval for now).
- Basic layout and static components are implemented in the frontend codebase.
- The design is intuitive and aligns with the application's existing look and feel.

## Plan

1. **Information Gathering and Inspiration:**
   - Search for examples of AI-assisted scheduling UIs or similar complex data interaction UIs.
   - Analyze the existing frontend structure in `src/frontend` to understand the framework, component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap, custom components), and overall design language.
   - Identify common UI patterns used in the application.

2. **Wireframing/Layout Description:**
   - Based on findings and task requirements, create textual descriptions or simple wireframes for:
     - AI Generation Controls
     - AI Schedule Suggestion View
     - Suggestion Application Process
     - Status/Feedback Area
   - Focus on user flow and information hierarchy.

3. **Static Component Implementation:**
   - Identify or create appropriate files in `src/frontend/components/` (assuming a component-based structure) or relevant views.
   - Implement the HTML structure and basic CSS for the new UI elements based on the wireframes/descriptions.
   - Use placeholder content and ensure responsiveness if applicable.

## Next Steps (after this task)

- Integrate with AI scheduling API endpoints.
- Implement dynamic data loading and interaction.
