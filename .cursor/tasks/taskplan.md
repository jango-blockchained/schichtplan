## âœ… Task Checklist

### 1. Backend: Scheduler Assignment Logic
- [ ] Implement core assignment loop in `distribution.py` (`assign_employees_for_day` and related methods)
    - [ ] Iterate through shifts and identify available employees
    - [ ] Score employee-shift pairs
    - [ ] Select best employees for each shift
    - [ ] Create `ScheduleAssignment` records
- [ ] Integrate scoring adjustments:
    - [ ] Implement `_calculate_history_adjustment_v2` for fair distribution
    - [ ] Implement `_calculate_preference_adjustment_v2` for employee preferences
    - [ ] Integrate other planned scoring factors (workload, overstaffing, ML hooks)
- [ ] Refactor `_save_to_database` in `generator.py` for bulk insertion
- [ ] Standardize data structures (dicts vs. objects) throughout scheduler logic
- [ ] Implement `_load_employee_preferences` in `DistributionManager`

### 2. Backend: Data Consistency and Validation
- [ ] Refactor fragile import mechanisms in `resources.py`, `availability.py`, `constraints.py`, `coverage_utils.py`
- [ ] Validate and clean up data:
    - [ ] Ensure all shift assignments include complete time data
    - [ ] Add comprehensive validation during data loading (shift times, coverage rules, etc.)
    - [ ] Investigate and resolve inconsistent use of `getattr`/`hasattr`
- [ ] Safeguard demo data generation (disable in production)

### 3. Backend: Constraint and Coverage Logic
- [ ] Consolidate constraint checking to a single, consistent approach
- [ ] Replace broad exception handling with specific error types
- [ ] Review and clarify coverage overlap and fallback logic

### 4. Frontend: Data Handling and UI Improvements
- [ ] Refactor frontend data mapping/grouping logic in `ScheduleTable.tsx` and related components
- [ ] Remove frontend workarounds for missing time data or duplicate entries
- [ ] Simplify state management in hooks like `useScheduleData.ts` and `useVersionControl.ts`

### 5. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Expand backend tests for assignment logic, data validation, and constraints
- [ ] Add/extend frontend tests for UI and data handling
- [ ] Perform manual QA for schedule generation with various data scenarios

### 6. Documentation and Developer Experience
- [ ] Update developer docs for new assignment logic, data structures, and API changes
- [ ] Add code comments in complex or refactored areas
- [ ] Review and update README for setup, development, and troubleshooting

### 7. Performance and Monitoring
- [ ] Profile schedule generation and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] Improve logging for clarity and context
- [ ] Monitor logs and error reports for regressions
