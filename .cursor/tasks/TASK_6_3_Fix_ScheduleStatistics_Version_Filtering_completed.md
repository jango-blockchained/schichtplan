# Task: Fix ScheduleStatistics.tsx Version Filtering

**ID:** TASK_6_3_Fix_ScheduleStatistics_Version_Filtering
**Status:** completed
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Addressing Known Issues

**Description:**
Ensure version filtering in `ScheduleStatistics.tsx` works correctly and reliably.

**Progress:**
- Analyzed the ScheduleStatistics.tsx component and found issues with version filtering logic
- Identified potential problems:
  1. The component receives schedules and filters them by version, causing inconsistent behavior when the parent component has already filtered them
  2. Debug logs showed potential discrepancies between expected and actual filtering results
  3. Some schedules might be missing version information altogether
  4. There was redundant filtering logic that could lead to data inconsistencies

**Solution Implemented:**
1. Enhanced Version Filtering Logic:
   - Added validation to check if the requested version exists in the data
   - Improved fallback logic when the requested version isn't found in the data
   - Added detailed logging about version distribution and filtering results

2. Added Input Validation:
   - Added validation for input props with fallbacks for missing data
   - Handled the case where schedules array might be null or undefined
   - Improved filtering of valid schedules with more robust validation

3. Improved Debugging:
   - Added comprehensive logging of version distribution
   - Added detailed analysis of schedule types (with/without shifts, with/without times)
   - Enhanced schedule error detection and reporting

4. Made Component More Resilient:
   - Added fallbacks for missing or invalid data
   - Ensured the component won't crash due to inconsistent data
   - Improved error handling throughout the component

**Results:**
The component now handles version filtering more robustly, properly validates all input data, and includes comprehensive logging to help identify any issues. The component is more resilient to data inconsistencies and provides clearer information about its internal state for debugging.
