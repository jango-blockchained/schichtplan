# Task: Create Core Schedule Visualization Component

## Overview
Develop a clean, modern React component for visualizing schedules with a focus on simplicity, performance, and usability.

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
TASK002_research_ui_patterns
TASK004_create_wireframes

## Objectives
- Implement a responsive schedule visualization component
- Support different view modes (day, week, month)
- Add drag-and-drop capabilities for manual adjustments
- Implement visual indicators for AI-suggested shifts
- Optimize rendering for large datasets

## Details

### Component Architecture
- Create a new component in `src/frontend/src/components/Schedule/AiScheduleView.tsx`
- Implement modular subcomponents for different aspects:
  - TimeGrid for time-based visualization
  - EmployeeList for employee display
  - ShiftBlock for individual shift representation
  - ViewControls for switching between view modes
  - LegendPanel for explaining visual indicators

### Key Features
1. **Responsive Grid Layout**
   - Implement a grid system that adapts to screen size
   - Support horizontal and vertical scrolling for large datasets
   - Ensure readability on all devices

2. **Multiple View Modes**
   - Day view with detailed hour breakdown
   - Week view with daily summary
   - Month view for long-term planning
   - Employee-centric vs. time-centric views

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Drag-and-drop for shift reassignment
   - Click/tap for detailed information
   - Pinch-to-zoom for mobile users
   - Context menus for quick actions

4. **Visual Indicators**
   - Distinct styling for AI-suggested shifts
   - Color coding for different shift types
   - Visual cues for constraint violations
   - Availability status indicators

### Technical Approach
- Use React with TypeScript for type safety
- Leverage CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout
- Consider using a virtualized list library for performance
- Implement render optimization techniques for large datasets

### Deliverables
- AiScheduleView component and related subcomponents
- CSS/styling for all visual elements
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Storybook examples (if applicable)
- Documentation for component API and usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Component renders schedules accurately according to wireframes
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices
- All interactive features function as expected
- Performance is acceptable with large datasets (100+ employees)
- Visual indicators clearly differentiate between shift types and AI suggestions

## Estimated Effort
4 days

## Notes
- Focus on maintainability and code clarity
- Consider accessibility from the start
- Design component API to be flexible for future enhancements
