# Task: Implement AI Scheduling Service

## Overview
Develop a backend service that implements AI-powered schedule generation, leveraging the existing AI scheduling settings in the database.

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
TASK003_define_ai_scheduling_algorithm

## Objectives
- Create a scheduler service that uses AI techniques to generate optimized schedules
- Implement algorithms to analyze employee availability, coverage requirements, and constraints
- Develop a scoring system to evaluate schedule quality
- Add optimization logic to refine initial schedules
- Integrate with existing database models and structures

## Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create a new service in `src/backend/services/scheduler/ai_scheduler.py`
- Leverage existing `ai_scheduling` settings from the Settings model
- Implement constraint satisfaction programming techniques
- Develop scoring functions for different optimization objectives
- Add progressive refinement capabilities

### Core Components
1. **Data Collection Module**
   - Gather employee availability data
   - Load shift templates and coverage requirements
   - Retrieve constraints and preferences
   - Access historical scheduling patterns

2. **Constraint Processing Module**
   - Model hard constraints (availability, required skills)
   - Model soft constraints (preferences, fairness)
   - Implement constraint propagation mechanisms
   - Develop conflict detection and resolution

3. **Schedule Generation Engine**
   - Implement initial schedule creation algorithm
   - Develop iterative improvement mechanisms
   - Add randomness/diversity to generation options
   - Implement schedule completion detection

4. **Evaluation and Scoring Module**
   - Create metrics for schedule quality
   - Implement multi-objective scoring
   - Develop visualization of constraint satisfaction
   - Create explanations for scheduling decisions

### Deliverables
- AI scheduling service implementation
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Documentation of the algorithm and its parameters
- Performance benchmarks for various scenarios
- Integration with existing database models

## Acceptance Criteria
- Service successfully generates valid schedules
- Generated schedules satisfy all hard constraints
- Soft constraints are optimized according to priorities
- Performance is acceptable for typical data volumes
- Integration with existing models is clean and maintainable

## Estimated Effort
5 days

## Notes
- Consider using third-party constraint solver libraries if appropriate
- Focus on explainability - the system should be able to justify its decisions
- Design for extensibility as requirements evolve
- Consider implementing a tiered approach (fast initial generation, followed by optimization)
