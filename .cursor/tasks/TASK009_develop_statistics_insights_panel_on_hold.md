# Task: Develop Statistics and Insights Panel

## Overview
Create a dashboard panel that displays meaningful statistics and actionable insights about the generated schedule.

## Priority
Medium

## Dependencies
TASK006_create_schedule_visualization_component

## Objectives
- Create a dashboard showing key schedule metrics
- Implement visualizations of coverage fulfillment
- Add employee satisfaction metrics
- Create alerts for potential issues
- Design suggestions panel for improvements

## Details

### Component Architecture
- Create a new component in `src/frontend/src/components/Schedule/InsightsPanel.tsx`
- Implement subcomponents for different metrics:
  - CoverageMetrics for staffing level analysis
  - EmployeeMetrics for satisfaction and fairness
  - QualityIndicators for overall schedule health
  - IssueAlerts for potential problems
  - SuggestionList for improvement recommendations

### Key Metrics and Visualizations
1. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Heatmap showing over/understaffing by time period
   - Percentage of coverage requirements fulfilled
   - Identification of critical coverage gaps
   - Historical comparison with previous schedules

2. **Employee Metrics**
   - Fairness indicator (distribution of desirable/undesirable shifts)
   - Preference satisfaction rate per employee
   - Work hour distribution analysis
   - Comparison to contracted hours

3. **Schedule Quality Indicators**
   - Overall quality score with breakdown
   - Constraint satisfaction percentage
   - Optimization level compared to theoretical optimum
   - Stability measure (changes from previous schedule)

4. **Issue Alerts**
   - Critical understaffing periods
   - Labor law compliance warnings
   - Employee overwork indicators
   - Skill coverage gaps

5. **Improvement Suggestions**
   - AI-generated recommendations for specific improvements
   - Impact assessment of each suggestion
   - One-click application of suggestions
   - Learning from accepted/rejected suggestions

### Technical Approach
- Use React for component structure
- Implement data visualization with charts.js, recharts, or similar
- Use context or Redux for state management
- Implement responsive design for all visualizations

### Deliverables
- InsightsPanel component and related subcomponents
- Visualization implementations for all metrics
- Integration with schedule data
- Unit tests for components
- Documentation for component API and usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Panel displays accurate metrics based on schedule data
- Visualizations are clear and informative
- Alerts correctly identify potential issues
- Suggestions are relevant and actionable
- All components are responsive and work on mobile devices

## Estimated Effort
4 days

## Notes
- Focus on actionable insights rather than just raw data
- Ensure visualizations are accessible (color blindness, etc.)
- Consider performance with large datasets

## AI On Hold Note
