## Schichtplan - DistributionManager Test Coverage Enhancement

**Date:** 2024-07-27

**Status:**
*   Initial review of `DistributionManager` and its tests (`src/backend/tests/scheduler/test_distribution.py`) completed.
*   Significant test coverage gaps identified, especially for core assignment logic.
*   Two new tests for `assign_employees_by_type` (successful assignment, no available employees) have been added to `test_distribution.py`.
*   Pre-existing linter errors in `test_distribution.py` related to method signature mismatches have been fixed.
*   The file `src/backend/tests/scheduler/test_distribution.py` has been updated and changes accepted.

**Summary of `DistributionManager` Test Coverage Review:**
*   **Existing Tests:** Cover basic initialization, categorization, base scoring, high-level metrics, and simple update_with_assignment.
*   **Major Gaps:**
    *   Core assignment logic (`assign_employees_by_type`, `generate_assignments_for_day`, `_perform_interval_based_assignments`, `_try_find_and_make_assignment`) lacks direct tests.
    *   Detailed aspects of `calculate_assignment_score` (history, preference, seniority adjustments) are untested.
    *   Many helper/utility functions, fairness metric calculations, error handling, and dependency interactions also need tests.
    *   Interval-based logic and ML/FeatureExtractor integration are untested.

**Remaining Proposed Test Cases for `DistributionManager` (Prioritized):**

**I. Core Assignment Logic (Highest Priority - Continued)**
*   **`assign_employees_by_type` (More Scenarios):**
    *   Multiple shifts, multiple employees (all assigned).
    *   More shifts than available/suitable employees (partial assignment).
    *   Employee becomes unavailable due to `max_shifts_per_day`.
    *   `ConstraintChecker` prevents assignment.
    *   `AvailabilityChecker` marks employee as `UNAVAILABLE`.
    *   Preference for "FIXED" assignment type.
    *   Sorting of available employees by score.
*   **`generate_assignments_for_day`:**
    *   Basic successful day assignment.
    *   No `potential_shifts`.
    *   Intervals already fully staffed.
    *   Partial staffing due to limits.
    *   Complex day with overlapping shifts.
*   **`_perform_interval_based_assignments`:**
    *   Single interval staffing.
    *   Interval needs multiple employees.
    *   `_try_find_and_make_assignment` returns `None`.
*   **`_try_find_and_make_assignment`:**
    *   Successful assignment (dependencies mocked).
    *   No candidate shifts.
    *   All candidates fail constraint checks.
    *   All candidates unavailable.
    *   Keyholder required, none available.
    *   Specific skills required, none available.

**II. Assignment Scoring Logic (`calculate_assignment_score` and its components)**
*   **`calculate_assignment_score` (Comprehensive):**
    *   Only base score active.
    *   Only history adjustment active.
    *   Only preference adjustment active.
    *   Only seniority adjustment active.
    *   All adjustments active.
*   **`_calculate_history_adjustment_v2`:**
    *   No history for shift type.
    *   High ratio of shift type.
    *   Low ratio of shift type.
*   **`_calculate_preference_adjustment_v2`:**
    *   `availability_type_override` is `PREFERRED`.
    *   `availability_type_override` is `AVAILABLE` (matches general preferences).
    *   `availability_type_override` is `AVAILABLE` (matches "avoided" day/type).
    *   `availability_type_override` is `UNAVAILABLE`.
*   **`_calculate_seniority_adjustment`:**
    *   Test with varying mocked seniority.

**III. Initialization and Data Loading**
*   **`_initialize_assignments`:**
    *   `self.resources` is None.
    *   `self.resources.employees` is empty.
    *   Employee objects lack 'id'.
*   **`_load_historical_assignments`:**
    *   No historical data.
    *   Historical data provided.
*   **`_load_employee_preferences`:**
    *   No preference data.
    *   Preference data provided.

**IV. Fairness Metrics (Individual component tests)**
*   `_calculate_fairness_score`
*   `_calculate_gini_coefficient`
*   `_calculate_variance`

**V. Utility Functions and Edge Cases**
*   `is_shift_assigned`
*   `is_interval_covered`

**Next Steps:**
1. Continue implementing the proposed test cases for `DistributionManager`, starting with the remaining scenarios for `assign_employees_by_type`.
