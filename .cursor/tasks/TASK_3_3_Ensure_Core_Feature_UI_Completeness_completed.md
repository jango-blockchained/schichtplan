# Task: Ensure Core Feature UI Completeness

**ID:** TASK_3_3_Ensure_Core_Feature_UI_Completeness
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Frontend Stability & Core Features

**Description:**
Verify that all core functionalities identified (Shift plan CRUD, shift definitions, availability management, initiating schedule generation, viewing statistics) have a complete and usable UI.

**UI Completeness Review Findings:**

Based on the review of relevant frontend files:

*   **Shift Definitions:** The UI for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting shifts appears complete and usable (`ShiftsPage.tsx`, `ShiftEditor.tsx`, `ShiftForm.tsx`).
*   **Shift Plan CRUD:** The UI provides functionality for viewing existing shift plans, manually adding single schedule entries, updating assignments (via drag-and-drop or manual updates), and deleting assignments and entire versions (`SchedulePage.tsx`, `ScheduleManager.tsx`, `AddScheduleDialog.tsx`, `VersionTable.tsx`). This appears complete.
*   **Availability Management:** The UI allows users to specify employee availability by day and time slot with different availability types (`EmployeeAvailabilityModal.tsx`, `AvailabilityTypeSelect.tsx`). This appears complete.
*   **Initiating Schedule Generation:** The UI includes controls and settings for triggering both standard and AI-based schedule generation (`SchedulePage.tsx`, `ScheduleActions.tsx`, `ScheduleGenerationSettings.tsx`). This appears complete.
*   **Viewing Statistics:** The UI displays relevant statistics for the viewed schedule, filtered by version and date range (`SchedulePage.tsx`, `ScheduleStatistics.tsx`). This appears complete.

Overall, the core functionalities of the application appear to have complete and usable user interfaces based on the reviewed files.
