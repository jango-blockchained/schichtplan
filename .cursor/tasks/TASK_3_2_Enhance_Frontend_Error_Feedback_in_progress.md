# Task: Enhance Frontend Error Handling & User Feedback

**ID:** TASK_3_2_Enhance_Frontend_Error_Feedback
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Frontend Stability & Core Features

**Description:**
Implement consistent error handling for API calls. Provide clear user feedback for loading states, errors (e.g., using toasts or modals), and successful operations. Ensure graceful degradation if parts of the UI can't load.

**Review Findings & Refined Plan:**

1.  **Review of `src/frontend/src/services/api.ts`**: The API service uses Axios interceptors for centralized basic error handling, catching non-2xx responses and throwing `Error` objects with messages.

2.  **Review of Hooks (`useVersionControl.ts`, `useScheduleGeneration.ts`)**: These hooks effectively use `react-query`'s `onError` and `onSuccess` callbacks and `useToast` to display feedback for API call outcomes. `useScheduleGeneration.ts` also manages detailed loading/progress state.

3.  **Identified Areas for Further Review**: Need to identify other frontend components or hooks that might be making direct API calls without using `react-query` hooks.

4.  **Refined Plan:**
    *   Identify and review all locations in the frontend making API calls.
    *   Ensure all API interactions (loading, success, error) trigger appropriate user feedback (primarily using `useToast`).
    *   Implement or enhance loading indicators in relevant UI components.
    *   Consider strategies for graceful degradation when data fetching fails.
    *   Document the standardized approach to API error handling and user feedback in the frontend.
