**Description:**
Perform basic testing on major modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to identify and fix critical compatibility issues.

This task requires manual testing on multiple web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). As an AI, I do not have the capability to open browsers and perform interactive manual testing. This task requires human intervention to execute the tests and report findings.
