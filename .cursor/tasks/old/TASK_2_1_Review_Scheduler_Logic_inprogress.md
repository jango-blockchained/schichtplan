# Task: Comprehensive Review of Core Scheduler Logic

**ID:** TASK_2_1_Review_Scheduler_Logic
**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** High
**Category:** Backend Stability & Core Features

**Description:**
Conduct a thorough code review of the core scheduling components (`generator.py`, `distribution.py`, `resources.py`, `availability.py`, `constraints.py`). Focus on logic clarity, efficiency, error handling, and adherence to requirements outlined in `project-prompt.mdc`.

**Progress:**
- Completed initial review of `generator.py`, `resources.py`, `availability.py`, and `constraints.py`
- Identified key findings:
  - **Import Structure**: All modules have extensive fallback import logic to handle different execution environments, which may cause confusion. Consider standardizing imports.
  - **Error Handling**: Good error handling throughout with detailed logging, but some edge cases (like handling invalid time formats) could be improved.
  - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with multiple specialized loggers. `ProcessTracker` in `generator.py` provides detailed step-by-step tracking.
  - **Resource Management**: `ScheduleResources` handles all data loading with proper error handling, but cache management could be optimized.
  - **Schedule Generation Flow**: Follows logical sequence of loading resources → processing coverage → creating shifts → assigning employees.
  - **Constraints Implementation**: Thorough constraint checking for employee assignments, but some methods seem duplicated (e.g., old and new constraint checking approaches).

**Next Steps:**
- Review `distribution.py` (file is large, need detailed analysis)
- Review integration between modules and potential optimization points
- Create detailed recommendations for code improvements
- Update documentation once full review is complete
- Mark task as completed after comprehensive review and recommendations
