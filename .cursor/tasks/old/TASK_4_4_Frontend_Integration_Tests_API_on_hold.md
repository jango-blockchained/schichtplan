# Task: Frontend Integration Tests (API Interactions)

**ID:** TASK_4_4_Frontend_Integration_Tests_API
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Testing

**Description:**
Test frontend components that interact with the backend API by mocking API calls (e.g., using `msw` - Mock Service Worker) to ensure correct data fetching, submission, and error handling.


## AI On Hold Note
This task is being put on hold. It requires stable API endpoints and frontend components that consume them. Several related API and component development/refactoring tasks are still `_in_progress` or `_on_hold`. It's more effective to implement these integration tests once those dependencies are more settled. Consider setting up MSW (Mock Service Worker) as a foundational step when this task is resumed.
