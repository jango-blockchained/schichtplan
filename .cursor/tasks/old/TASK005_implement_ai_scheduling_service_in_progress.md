# Task: Implement AI Scheduling Service

## Overview
Develop a backend service that implements AI-powered schedule generation, leveraging the existing AI scheduling settings in the database.

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
TASK003_define_ai_scheduling_algorithm

## Objectives
- Create a scheduler service that uses AI techniques to generate optimized schedules
- Implement algorithms to analyze employee availability, coverage requirements, and constraints
- Develop a scoring system to evaluate schedule quality
- Add optimization logic to refine initial schedules
- Integrate with existing database models and structures

## Details

### Implementation Approach
- Create a new service in `src/backend/services/scheduler/ai_scheduler.py`
- Leverage existing `ai_scheduling` settings from the Settings model
- Implement constraint satisfaction programming techniques
- Develop scoring functions for different optimization objectives
- Add progressive refinement capabilities

### Core Components
1. **Data Collection Module**
   - Gather employee availability data
   - Load shift templates and coverage requirements
   - Retrieve constraints and preferences
   - Access historical scheduling patterns

2. **Constraint Processing Module**
   - Model hard constraints (availability, required skills)
   - Model soft constraints (preferences, fairness)
   - Implement constraint propagation mechanisms
   - Develop conflict detection and resolution

3. **Schedule Generation Engine**
   - Implement initial schedule creation algorithm
   - Develop iterative improvement mechanisms
   - Add randomness/diversity to generation options
   - Implement schedule completion detection

4. **Evaluation and Scoring Module**
   - Create metrics for schedule quality
   - Implement multi-objective scoring
   - Develop visualization of constraint satisfaction
   - Create explanations for scheduling decisions

### Deliverables
- AI scheduling service implementation
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Documentation of the algorithm and its parameters
- Performance benchmarks for various scenarios
- Integration with existing database models

## Acceptance Criteria
- Service successfully generates valid schedules
- Generated schedules satisfy all hard constraints
- Soft constraints are optimized according to priorities
- Performance is acceptable for typical data volumes
- Integration with existing models is clean and maintainable

## Estimated Effort
5 days

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create the main service file and basic structure**:
   - Create directory `src/backend/services/scheduler/` if it doesn't exist.
   - Create file `src/backend/services/scheduler/ai_scheduler.py`.
   - The file will contain a class `AIScheduler` with placeholder methods: `collect_data`, `process_constraints`, `generate_schedule`, `evaluate_schedule`.
2. **Implement the Data Collection Module**:
   - Identify relevant database models for employee availability, shift templates, coverage requirements, constraints, preferences, and historical data.
   - Write database queries to retrieve this information.
3. **Implement the Constraint Processing Module**:
   - Model hard constraints (e.g., availability, required skills).
   - Model soft constraints (e.g., preferences, fairness).
   - Implement conflict detection and resolution logic.
   - Define how constraints are represented and stored.
4. **Implement the Schedule Generation Engine and Evaluation/Scoring Module**:
   - Implement an algorithm for initial schedule creation (referencing `TASK003_define_ai_scheduling_algorithm_completed.md`).
   - Develop iterative improvement mechanisms.
   - Create metrics for schedule quality and implement a multi-objective scoring system.
   - Consider using third-party constraint solver libraries if appropriate and not already decided against in `TASK003`.
5. **Unit Tests and Documentation**:
   - Write unit tests for core functionality.
   - Document the algorithm and its parameters.

## Notes
- Consider using third-party constraint solver libraries if appropriate
- Focus on explainability - the system should be able to justify its decisions
- Design for extensibility as requirements evolve
- Consider implementing a tiered approach (fast initial generation, followed by optimization)

## Progress Log

- Outlined the `AIScheduler` class structure in `src/backend/services/scheduler/ai_scheduler.py` with placeholder methods (`collect_data`, `process_constraints`, `generate_schedule`, `evaluate_schedule`).
- Added basic logic and comments for collecting data from relevant models.
- Outlined the structure for hard and soft constraints within `process_constraints`, adding initial logic/comments for:
    - Availability Constraints (initial iteration logic added)
    - Absence Constraints (initial iteration logic added)
    - Coverage Requirements (initial iteration and aggregation logic added)
    - Keyholder Requirements (initial logic based on coverage added)
    - Working Hours Limits (initial structure added)
    - Rest Period Requirements (initial structure added)
    - Preference Satisfaction (initial iteration and placeholder scoring added)
    - Fair Distribution (initial structure added)
    - Skill Matching (initial structure and placeholder population added)
    - Shift Continuity (initial structure and comments added)
    - Seniority Consideration (initial structure and comments added)
- Outlined the three phases of schedule generation within `generate_schedule` based on TASK003:
    - Initial Assignment Phase (basic iteration, eligibility check based on availability/absence, greedy assignment logic added)
    - Constraint Validation Phase (structure and comments outlining checks added)
    - Optimization Phase (structure and comments outlining strategies added)
- Added basic structure and comments for the `evaluate_schedule` method.
- Fixed linter error by passing `data` to `generate_schedule`.
