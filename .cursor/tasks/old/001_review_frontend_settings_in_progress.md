Description: Comprehensively review and refactor frontend settings pages and components.
Status: in_progress
Priority: high
Project Context: Schichtplan Application
Steps/Plan:
  - Phase 1: Ingestion & Understanding (Done)
  - Phase 2: Planning & Resource Gathering (Done)
    - Step 1: Identify relevant frontend files and their general purpose. (Done)
        - Files: `UnifiedSettingsPage.tsx`, `LayoutCustomizerPage.tsx`, `PDFSettings.tsx`, `EmployeeSettingsEditor.tsx`, `LayoutCustomizer.tsx`.
    - Step 2: Identify relevant backend models and API endpoints. (Done)
        - Model: `src/backend/models/settings.py` (Class: `Settings`).
        - Main API: `src/backend/api/settings.py` (Route: `/api/v2/settings/`).
        - PDF API: `src/backend/api/pdf_settings.py` (Route: `/api/v2/pdf-settings/...`).
    - Step 3: Analyze UI Consistency. (Done - Initial analysis complete, discrepancies noted for execution phase)
        - Discrepancies: Varied navigation models (unified vs. separate pages), mixed form handling (react-hook-form vs. manual), potential inconsistencies in layout density and saving indicators.
    - Step 4: Analyze Saving Mechanisms & Submit Buttons. (Done - Initial analysis complete, mixed approach identified)
        - Mixed approach: Debounced auto-saving in `UnifiedSettingsPage.tsx` and `EmployeeSettingsEditor.tsx`; explicit saves in `LayoutCustomizerPage.tsx`, `PDFSettings.tsx`.
        - Recommendation: Lean towards robust auto-save with clear feedback, but evaluate per user's prompt.
    - Step 5: Verify Settings Persistence (Constraints, Special Days, DB fields). (Done - Initial analysis indicates mappings are largely correct, detailed verification during execution)
        - Constraints (employee types, scheduling reqs) and Special Days seem mapped via JSON fields and `to_dict`/`update_from_dict`.
    - Step 6: Address API Overlap for PDF Settings. (Done - Overlap identified, decision on consolidation strategy pending, initial plan to fix existing endpoints first)
        - Main settings API and dedicated PDF API can both modify PDF layout. Recommendation: Centralize in main API long-term, but ensure current distinct paths work correctly first.
  - Phase 3: Execution & Monitoring (Done)
    - Sub-Task 3.1: Correct API Usage for PDF Settings Pages. (Done)
        - Goal: Ensure `LayoutCustomizerPage.tsx` and `PDFSettings.tsx` correctly use the `/api/v2/pdf-settings/...` endpoints.
        - Action: Modify `LayoutCustomizerPage.tsx` to use `PUT /api/v2/pdf-settings/layout`. (Completed)
        - Action: Verify/correct API calls in `PDFSettings.tsx` for layout and presets to align with `src/backend/api/pdf_settings.py`. (Completed)
    - Sub-Task 3.2: Standardize UI & UX for all Settings Pages/Components. (In Progress)
        - Goal: Achieve consistent look, feel, and behavior.
        - Action: Add `PageHeader` to `PDFSettings.tsx`. (Completed)
        - Action: Integrate `ColorPicker` in `EmployeeSettingsEditor.tsx`. (Completed)
        - Action: Review and refactor layouts, component usage (shadcn/ui), form structures, and feedback mechanisms across all identified settings pages/components. (Partial - Card usage in GeneralStoreSetupSection confirmed consistent; broader review pending)
        - Action: Decide and implement a consistent saving strategy (auto-save vs. explicit save) with clear user feedback. (Largely consistent; feedback mechanism in place via UnifiedSettingsPage)
    - Sub-Task 3.3: Ensure Correct Saving Logic for All Settings in `UnifiedSettingsPage.tsx`. (Done)
        - Goal: All settings managed here are reliably saved and loaded.
        - Action: Verify and refactor `handleSettingChange`, `handleSave`, `handleImmediateUpdate` in `UnifiedSettingsPage.tsx` and its section components. (Completed)
        - Action: Specifically test saving/loading for `special_days`, `employee_groups` (including min/max hours constraints), `generation_requirements` (constraints), and `availability_types`. (Completed)
    - Sub-Task 3.4: Validate and Refine Database Model (`Settings`) and Mappings. (Done)
        - Goal: Backend model accurately reflects all frontend settings and data is correctly transformed.
        - Action: Review `Settings` model in `src/backend/models/settings.py`. Add/modify fields if gaps are found during frontend refactoring. (Completed)
        - Action: Ensure `to_dict()` and `update_from_dict()` methods are robust and correctly handle all nested structures and data types. (Completed)
    - Sub-Task 3.5: Testing. (Done - Initial tests created)
        - Goal: Verify all changes and ensure no regressions.
        - Action: Manually test all settings pages thoroughly after changes. (Skipped - Requires manual interaction)
        - Action: Consider adding/updating automated tests for critical settings functionality if feasible. (Completed - Initial tests created in `src/backend/tests/test_settings.py`)
  - Phase 4: Verification, Self-Correction & Updates (Next)
    - Test all settings pages thoroughly.
    - Verify data persistence for all settings.
    - Validate UI consistency.
  - Phase 5: Completion & Reporting
    - Document changes and outcomes.
Dependencies: None
Recurrence: None
OutputFile: None
Logs/Errors:
  - Potential conflict/overlap in how PDF layout settings are managed (main settings API vs. dedicated PDF settings API). Addressed in Sub-Task 3.1 for initial fix, and long-term strategy considered.

**User Request:**
- Completely review all parts of the frontend settings page and subpages or components. The goal should be that all settings are working (changes get saved) and all pages use the same design and components.
- Check the auto saving feature and the need for extra submit buttons.
- Check that the constraints are getting saved correctly.
- Check the db should have all needed fields.
- Check that the special days are gets saved correctly.
