# Task: Frontend State Management Review

**ID:** TASK_3_4_Frontend_State_Management_Review
**Status:** pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Category:** Frontend Stability & Core Features

**Description:**
Review the current frontend state management strategy (e.g., React Context, Zustand, Redux). Ensure it's efficient, scalable for the application's needs, and avoids unnecessary re-renders or prop drilling.

**State Management Review Findings:**

Based on the review of key frontend files (`SchedulePage.tsx`, `useVersionControl.ts`, `useScheduleGeneration.ts`, `ScheduleStatistics.tsx`, `EmployeeAvailabilityModal.tsx`, `api.ts`):

*   The application primarily uses a combination of `useState` for local component/hook state and `@tanstack/react-query` for managing server state (data fetching, caching, mutations).
*   `react-query` is effectively used for handling asynchronous operations and server data synchronization, contributing positively to efficiency and scalability regarding server state.
*   `useState` is appropriately used for transient UI states and component-specific data.
*   Prop drilling exists in some areas, particularly related to passing data and handlers down from `SchedulePage.tsx`. While not severe currently, it's a potential area for future refactoring if component nesting deepens.
*   There is no indication of a centralized global state management library (like Redux, Zustand) or extensive use of React Context for application-wide state beyond what `react-query` provides for server state. This is acceptable for the current scope but might be considered for future complexity.

**Conclusion:** The current state management strategy is sound, efficient for handling server state via `react-query`, and generally scalable for the application's present needs. Prop drilling is a minor concern to monitor.
