# Fix SQLAlchemy Linter Errors in Routes

## Description
Fix SQLAlchemy-related linter errors in the `src/backend/routes/schedules.py` file, primarily focused on ambiguous column access and other type-related issues.

## Context
The `schedules.py` file contains several linter errors related to SQLAlchemy:
1. "Access to generic instance variable through class is ambiguous" for column access
2. Type errors with `availability_type` parameters
3. Parameter issues with logger and scheduler config

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Identified all SQLAlchemy-related linter errors in `schedules.py`
2. ✅ Researched proper SQLAlchemy column access patterns in SQLAlchemy 2.0
3. ✅ Updated the logger.error method to accept an extra parameter
4. ✅ Various approaches to fix the SQLAlchemy linter errors were attempted

## Outcome
While we were able to fix the logger issue, the SQLAlchemy linter errors persist. These appear to be false positives due to inconsistencies between type checkers and the SQLAlchemy library.

According to SQLAlchemy documentation:
> It should be noted that for the time being, the ORM will still accept non-SQL Core constructs for backwards compatibility. While the most common are instances of `Column` and `InstrumentedAttribute`, various ORM functions continue to invoke the "entity" registry to convert any arbitrary Python class or mapper attribute into the equivalent SQL expression construct.

The linter errors are likely due to the ambiguity in how SQLAlchemy resolves class attributes to ORM/SQL expressions.

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding type annotations or ignoring specific linter errors for SQLAlchemy code
2. Consistently use either the legacy query style (`Model.query.filter()`) or new 2.0 style (`db.select()`) 
3. Investigate SQLAlchemy specific tools like `mypy-sqlalchemy` for better type checking

## Notes
The backend appears to be working correctly despite the linter errors, as demonstrated by the API request returning a 200 status.
