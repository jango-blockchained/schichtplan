# Backend Migrations Directory

This is an alternative migrations directory used when running the backend in standalone mode.

## Purpose

This directory contains Alembic migrations that are primarily used during development or 
for standalone backend operations. In most cases, you should use the primary migrations 
directory at `/src/migrations/` instead.

## When to Use This Directory

Use this directory only when:
1. Running the backend separately from the main application
2. Developing or testing backend-specific features
3. Instructed to do so in specific documentation

## Usage

From the backend directory:

```bash
# Using the Alembic CLI directly
alembic -c migrations/alembic.ini upgrade head
alembic -c migrations/alembic.ini revision -m "Description of changes"
```
