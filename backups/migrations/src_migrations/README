# Primary Migrations Directory

This is the primary migrations directory used by Flask-Migrate for the main application.

## Purpose

This directory contains Alembic migrations for the main database schema. It's integrated with 
the Flask application and should be used for most schema changes.

## Usage

From the project root directory:

```bash
# Create a new migration
flask db migrate -m "Description of changes"

# Apply migrations
flask db upgrade

# Roll back migrations
flask db downgrade
```

For more information, see the full [MIGRATIONS.md](/docs/MIGRATIONS.md) documentation.
