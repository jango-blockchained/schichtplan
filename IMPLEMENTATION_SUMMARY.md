### üèóÔ∏è Core Components Implemented

1. **ConversationManager** (`conversation_manager.py`)
   - Multi-turn conversation state management
   - Redis-based persistence with configurable TTL
   - Context compression and relevance scoring
   - Lifecycle hooks and cleanup automation

2. **AI Integration Framework** (`ai_integration.py`)
   - Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Intelligent model selection and cost optimization
   - Dynamic prompt generation and management
   - Structured tool calling and response processing

3. **Conversational MCP Service** (`conversational_mcp_service.py`)
   - Extended your existing MCP service with conversational capabilities
   - New MCP tools for conversation management
   - Intelligent tool chaining and workflow orchestration
   - Context-aware AI responses with tool usage

4. **Configuration System** (`config.py`)
   - Comprehensive configuration management
   - Environment-based configuration loading
   - Production/development configuration presets
   - Validation and error handling

5. **Testing & Deployment** 
   - Comprehensive test suite (`test_conversational_ai.py`)
   - Production-ready startup script (`start_conversational_ai.py`)
   - Installation automation (`install_conversational_ai.sh`)
   - Complete documentation (`CONVERSATIONAL_AI_README.md`)

## üìä Real Usage Example

```python
# Start a conversation
conversation = await start_conversation(
    user_id="scheduler_123",
    initial_goal="Optimize next week's schedule for better coverage"
)

# AI responds with analysis and questions
# User continues the conversation
response = await continue_conversation(
    conversation_id=conversation["conversation_id"],
    user_input="I'm seeing conflicts on Tuesday and Wednesday. Can you help resolve them?"
)

# AI automatically:
# 1. Calls analyze_schedule_conflicts()
# 2. Calls get_employee_availability() 
# 3. Provides specific recommendations
# 4. Asks clarifying questions

# User can continue with follow-ups
follow_up = await continue_conversation(
    conversation_id=conversation["conversation_id"], 
    user_input="What if I swap John and Mary's Tuesday shifts?"
)

# AI analyzes the impact and provides guidance
```
