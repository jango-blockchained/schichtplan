<think>Let me break down what the user is asking:

1. Create a new branch for developing the new split implementation
2. Perform a detailed comparison between the original file and the refactored components

First, I'll need to create a new branch using git. Then I'll compare the original schedule_generator.py with the new components in the scheduler folder to identify what functionality has been migrated and what still needs to be moved.</think>I'll help you create a new branch for this work and then perform a detailed comparison between the original file and the refactored components.

First, let's create a new branch for this development work:

```bash
git checkout -b refactor/schedule-generator-split
```
Now that we have our new branch, let's perform a detailed comparison between the original `schedule_generator.py` and the refactored components. First, I'll read the original file structure to compare:

Read file: /home/jango/Git/schichtplan/src/backend/services/schedule_generator.py
Now that I have a general overview, let's perform a detailed comparison between the original file and the refactored components.

## Detailed Comparison

Let's start with a detailed comparison between the original file's classes and their refactored counterparts:

### 1. Utility Functions

Original file has these utility functions:
- `is_early_shift`
- `is_late_shift`
- `requires_keyholder`

These don't appear to be refactored into the new structure yet. Let's check if they're in any of the new files:

Now let's look more closely at the ScheduleResources class in the original file and compare it with the refactored version:

Read file: /home/jango/Git/schichtplan/src/backend/services/schedule_generator.py
Let's also look at the original ScheduleGenerator class structure:

Read file: /home/jango/Git/schichtplan/src/backend/services/schedule_generator.py
Now let's check the validator class in the original file:

Ran tool
The validator appears to be a new class created during the refactoring process. Let's compare how much of the code from the original `ScheduleGenerator` class has been moved to the `validator.py` file:

Read file: /home/jango/Git/schichtplan/src/backend/services/scheduler/validator.py
Based on my analysis, I'll now provide a detailed comparison between the original file and the refactored components.

## Detailed Comparison: Original vs Refactored

### 1. Utility Functions

**Original:** 
- `is_early_shift`
- `is_late_shift`
- `requires_keyholder`

**Refactored:** 
- Not found in the new structure
- However, `requires_keyholder` property now exists directly on the Coverage model class
- References to these functions are still in the original file and need to be migrated

### 2. ScheduleResources Class

**Original:**
- Located directly in `schedule_generator.py`
- Methods:
  - `load_resources()`
  - `get_active_employees()`
  - `get_shifts()`
  - `get_availability_data()`
  - `get_coverage_data()`
  - `get_schedule_data()`
  - `add_schedule_entry()`
  - `get_schedule_entry()`
  - `remove_schedule_entry()`
  - `clear_schedule_data()`

**Refactored:**
- Located in `/scheduler/resources.py`
- Renamed methods:
  - `load()` (was `load_resources()`)
  - Added new methods for more focused resource operations:
    - `_load_settings()`
    - `_load_coverage()`
    - `_load_shifts()`
    - `_load_employees()`
    - `_load_absences()`
    - `_load_availabilities()`
    - `get_keyholders()`
    - `get_employees_by_group()`
    - `get_daily_coverage()`
    - `get_employee_absences()`
    - `get_employee_availability()`
    - `is_employee_available()`
- Missing original methods:
  - `get_schedule_data()`
  - `add_schedule_entry()`
  - `get_schedule_entry()`
  - `remove_schedule_entry()`
  - `clear_schedule_data()`

### 3. ScheduleGenerator Class

**Original:**
- Located directly in `schedule_generator.py`
- Key methods:
  - `__init__()`
  - `process_absences()`
  - `process_fix_availability()`
  - `fill_open_slots()`
  - `_check_tz_gfb_constraints()`
  - `verify_goals()`
  - `generate_schedule()`
  - Plus many helper methods

**Refactored:**
- Located in `/scheduler/generator.py`
- Renamed main method:
  - `generate()` (was `generate_schedule()`)
- Improved initialization to use the new components:
  - Uses the refactored `ScheduleResources` class
  - Uses the new `ScheduleValidator` class
- Missing verification functions:
  - `verify_goals()` (likely moved to validator)

### 4. ScheduleValidator Class (New)

**Original:**
- Did not exist as a separate class
- Validation logic was embedded in various `_verify_*` methods of the ScheduleGenerator class

**Refactored:**
- Located in `/scheduler/validator.py`
- New methods:
  - `validate()`
  - `_validate_coverage()`
  - `_validate_contracted_hours()`
  - `_validate_keyholders()`
  - `_validate_rest_periods()`
  - `_validate_max_shifts()`
  - `_validate_max_hours()`
- New supporting classes:
  - `ValidationError` data class
  - `ScheduleConfig` data class

## Missing Components and Issues

1. **Utility Functions:** The utility functions `is_early_shift`, `is_late_shift`, and `requires_keyholder` are still in the original file and not migrated to the new structure.

2. **ScheduleGenerator in __init__.py:** The `ScheduleGenerator` class is not exported in `__init__.py`.

3. **Schedule Data Management:** The schedule data management methods from `ScheduleResources` (`get_schedule_data()`, `add_schedule_entry()`, etc.) are missing in the refactored version.

4. **Integration:** The components have been split but the integration between them needs verification.

5. **Original File:** The original file still exists and is much larger than the refactored components combined, indicating more functionality needs to be migrated.

6. **API Changes:** The main public API has changed (`generate_schedule()` -> `generate()`), which may require updates to code that uses the ScheduleGenerator.

## Next Steps for Completing the Refactoring

1. Export `ScheduleGenerator` in the `__init__.py` file
2. Move utility functions to an appropriate location
3. Ensure all schedule data management methods are properly migrated
4. Verify the integration between components works correctly
5. Update any code that imports from the original file
6. Add tests for the refactored components
7. Remove the original file once all functionality is migrated
